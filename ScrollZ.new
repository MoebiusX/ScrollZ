      digits 1-6 represent color1 through color6 from COLOR SBAR
      whereas digits 7-9 and letters a-c represent color1 through
      color6 from COLOR SBAR2 - take a look at default status bar
      variables to see use of this then try COLOR SBAR BLACKBG to
      see it at work (idea and coding by Zakath)
fixed crash when there were no servers in server list (there were
      two related bugs, one on my part and the other is from stock
      client - this is system dependant, reported by Myrdraal)
fixed bitch mode bug (reported by ogre)
added ability to complete first matching channel name on ^T and

       (suggested by acidflash)
     - there will be no ScrollZ trademarks (in kicks, ...) when compiled
       with -DVILAS (hi Vilas :))))
     - wherever ScrollZ expects comma separated list of channels, -#channel
       is the same as setting would be off for #channel. Example:
       SHOWAWAY ON *,-#twilight_zone (requested by Zakath)
     - NEWHOST without arguments will list all available hostnames when
       compiled with -DJIMMIE, NEWHOST [#]number is also possible with this
     - ScrollZ now uses hash tables for nick lookups for faster searching
       (in general, it does 20% or less strcmp()s compared with linked lists)
     - BiGhEaD coded CTCP PAGE function, it will be included if compiled with
       -DCTCPPAGE
     - new flags to $J, D=HYPERDCC, P=CTCP PAGE
     - ScrollZ now reports line numbers with non matching {}s (requested by
       neuronik)
     - added $uhost() and $hhost(), they return user@host and host from
       nick!user@host respectively, when compiled with -DTDF (requested by

     - CDCC PLIST now accepts optinal list of channels
     - CDCC WARNING to toggle check on incoming DCCs (requested by everlast)

     - status bar updates only when needed (should help a lot on slower
       links when using telnet or ssh)
     - auto nick change will no longer take place when you get Nickname in use.
       Example: your nick was blah and you wanted to change it to boo, now
       if boo was already in use, ScrollZ would use boo_. It will keep blah
       from now on. Keep in mind that orignick will still work

     - ^[[#C is no longer supported due to screen bug (it wasn't needed

ScrollZ v1.8e, 27th of March, 1997

  We now have www.scrollz.com thanks to Ever|ast. Home page will be hosted
  there soon. You can also mail distro team members there. We also have
  ScrollZ mailing list, mail to majordomo@modex.net and put this into body
  of the message (not subject) : subscribe scrollz your@email.address
  To post, mail to scrollz@modex.net

  Added:
     - ADDW now accepts list of channels it is valid on, so you should
       either edit ScrollZ.save and add channels right after ADDW or remove
       all entries from ScrollZ.save and re-add them with ADDW
       (requested by vortexia)
     - ADDF now reports auto-op, vote, protection, god and flood check status,
       also notifying user you have just added about this (suggested by husk)
     - the same as above is now true for CTCP WHOAMI (suggested by JustMe_)
     - Zakath coded MREOP to mass re-op channel operators, this was actually
       in 1.8d too
     - OP, DOP, MOP, MDOP and MREOP now accept channel name as first argument
       (suggested by husk)
     - MOP now accepts -O like MDOP and MREOP
     - colored the rest of DCC messages (established, lost, completed)
     - OV OFF now removes sfwuckr user modes (suggested by E)
     - DIRLSN (requested by E)
     - VER * will request version from current channel (requested by noHUP)
     - FRLIST now accepts list of channels when set to on (requested by noHUP)
     - support for PART (LEAVE) reason if specified (works on 2.9 servers,
       thanks subzero)
     - C (formatted CSCAN) and S (scatter kicks support) to $J, when in
       uppercase client was compiled with support for those features
       (requested by neuronik)
     - CDCC STATS to toggle whether to display received/sent kB in CDCC PLIST
       (requested by noHUP)
     - ON JOIN_ME and ON CHANNEL_SYNCH for scripters (requested by acidflash
       and nyt)
     - CDCC PLIST will go to current channel when you set CDCC CHANNEL to
       current (suggested by arc)
     - SHITIGNORETIME to ScrollZ.save (this is what neuronik wanted)
     - MIRC to toggle whether we should convert mIRC color crap to ANSI
       (coded by Annanda, requested by several users)
     - LASTLOG -CLEAR to purge lastlog from memory (requested by E)
     - IG -t time to ignore users for time seconds (requested by arc)
     - two more format lines to OperVision. A kill parser will hopefully be
       ready for 1.8f (by Zakath)
     - client now parses numeric 437 (valid on 2.9 servers) and acts
       accordingly (requested by JustMe_)

  Changed:
     - users will be re-invited on kick only if they have both I and P flags
       set (pointed out by husk)
     - wordkick won't react on +F users (requested by vortexia)
     - status_server (%S) now holds full server name (requested by noHUP)
     - redone shit levels, they now act like friend levels with flags (this
       also lead to removing DEFAK and DEFABKI from ScrollZ.save, so ignore
       errors about that when loading old ScrollZ.save)
     - encryption for PASSWD, if you use this feature you need new decode.c
       too (get it from the home page)
     - TABKEY list now holds up to 10 nicks (requested by neuronik)
     - rewrote URL catcher, it should now work faster and use less CPU
     - removed FIND, not really needed since we have more powerfull SHOWUSER
     - removed CHOPS, the same reason as above
     - removed ML and MN, you can use alias for that
     - rewrote some parts of code to reduce client size
     - redirect now strips ANSI codes when you SET LASTLOG_ANSI ON
       (requested by Scrubbz)
     - when input line starts with M or MSG followed by some text and you
       press TAB, client acts like NICK_COMPLETION (bound to ^T by default).

       default tabkey handling (requested by Metalfan)
     - BAN now accepts multiple nicks/patterns as argument (requested by arc)
     - started to format TRACE, now accepts switches. Switches are:
         -o shows all opers
         -u shows all users (opers not included)
         -s shows all server connections
       For the time being, this is included only in TOOLIE, but it will become
       a general client command ni the next version when further formatting
       and more switches have been added. By Zakath, requested by myc.
     - Toolie Box style setaway in the C-Box, now displays and updates your
       away time. "SetAway: (Zakath) [T] Detached [SZon:1h23m14s]"
     - the split time shown in WHOLEFT is now parsed like the idle time in the
       toolie version of SETAWAY (by Zakath)

     - MSG #unknown_channel crash
     - crash when removing channel from whowas buffer
     - SINFO now works with 2.9 servers (reported by McSony)
     - replaced calls to next_arg with new_next_arg, this allows us to have
       tabs in aliases and commands (required for xSZsetup generated color
       schemes)
     - small glitch when we had a hook on notify_signoff_uh
     - users being auto-opped even if they didn't have +O set and being
       unbanned even if they didn't have +U set (this happened when you joined
       a channel and received channel operator status)
     - ADDN and REMN now accept multiple nicks (thanks cfatigue)
     - when user specifies ADDF flag more than once, we display it only once
       not as many times as user specified it (reported by arc)
     - we now report global CTCP requests (reported by arc)
     - possible crash with OV being active
     - permanent user mode is now sent to server on first connect
     - better timer now works, CPU usage won't sky rocket if you use it (even
       on time intervals less than a second!)
     - attempt has been made to fix STATS K, though there are several formats
       depending on ircd version so it might not work for all ircd versions
       (thanks arc)
     - crash when you were K-lined on a last server in server list
     - client will not reinvite users if FRLIST is not on for that channel
       (reported by husk)
     - banning users with usernames longer than nine characters (reported by
       entropy)

ScrollZ v1.8d, 12th of February, 1997

   Huh, where is 1.8c ? Well, I have released a couple of version marked as
   1.8c, but some had nasty bugs and I decided not to make that official new
   version for that reason. 1.8c was released prematurely due to some things
   that happened in January. Well, you have 1.8d here so enjoy :-).

  Added:
     - MK to kick mutliple nicks at the same time (requested by Ender)
     - more sign-off messages to ScrollZ.addon (some were contributed by
       runner)
     - LASTLOG -MAX # patch from Sheik (requested by arc)
     - SET LASTLOG_ANSI ON/OFF to toggle whether to strip ANSI in LASTLOG
       (compatible with BitchX)
     - LASTLOG now accepts wildcards
     - virtual hosting for those of you w/ this capability, you can now make
       use of the NEWHOST command. You can also specify the host at runtime by
       using the -H switch (irc -H host.com nick server:port). NOTE: This is
       *not* host spoofing, but for use with multiple IP's routed to the
       same machine. Type /sbin/route to see if you have any virtual hosts.
       (coded by Zakath)
     - function $isvoiced(nick channel). Returns 1 if person is VOICED only.
       If the person is op'd it will return 0. Use $ischanop() for that. 
       (reqeusted by neuronik, coded by Zakath)
     - SINFO command has been added. This is now the same as LUSERS, and
       offers a new more informative format. Colors used are CSCAN 1 and 2,
       for server header and stats, respectively (coded by Zakath)
     - Support for IRCHELP environment variable. Now you can setenv/export
       IRCHELP '/patch/to/irc/help' (requested by jimmie, coded by Zakath)
     - SPING to mesaure lag from you to a server. It's similar to PINGME, but
       now you can find network lag (coded by Zakath)
     - The Toolie C-BOX has been coded into the client. This is just stuff
       from toolie.irc that Zakath didn't feel like LOAD'ing anymore.
       Included are ToolZ style /SetAway,/Kick,/SignOff,/Luser, and /SC.
       With this, $Y is also set for use with scripting (coded by Zakath)
     - Three new colors, ME, NICK, and OV. They are as follows:
       ME 1: The *        NICK 1: Old nick      OV 1: Nick/Single server
       ME 2: Your nick    NICK 2: "known"       OV 2: Primary Server
       ME 3: Nick         NICK 3: New nick      OV 3: Secondary server
       ME 4: target       NICK 4: @ in CScan    OV 4: Command/Info
       ME 5: action       NICK 5: + in CScan    OV 5: Secondary Info
                                                OV 6: Server String []'s
     - new friend/shitted feature into publics. Anything said by someone in
       your friend listings will have <>'s equal to CSCAN color 2 (same as
       friends in CSCAN). Anything said by someone in your shit list will
       have <>'s equal to CSCAN color 6 (same as shitted people in CSCAN).
       Everything else (normal people) will still be controlled by PUBLIC
       Color 2 (default color2 has been changed in source - it was the same
       as colors for CSCAN) (requested by neuronik)
     - @ and + are now colored in CSCAN, SHOWUSER and FIND using color4 and
       color5 from color setting for nick (see above)
     - ADDFFLAG and ADDFCHAN now accept #number or filter (suggested by husk)

  Changed:
     - TBAN and CHOPS now accept channel name as argument (requested by noHUP)
     - FLOODP MAX will now wait 10 seconds for next nick change
     - idle time in WHOIS is now printed in days, hours, minutes and seconds
       (I forgot who requested this :-))
     - characters with ASCII codes below 32 are now printed in reverse
       (the way ircII handles them)
     - IG will now use user@domain info for ignore if only nick is given
       (requested by cfatigue)
     - NOIG now accepts #number, numbers are listed with IGNORE
       (suggested by ACiDFlaSH)
     - rewrote mode parsing routine, it should now take less CPU on mass modes
     - all additional ScrollZ status bar variables now return empty string in
       non-current windows if you set SHOW_STATUS_ALL to OFF
     - removed DCC TALK support (I haven't used this in my 3+ years on IRC :P)
     - J #channel will make #channel current channel (if you have already
       joined #channel of course, suggested by marl)
     - shitlisted users with level BKI are now ignored for 10*IGTIME seconds
       (requested by neuronik)

  Fixed:
     - yet another window problem related to OperVision (reported by
       ACiDFlaSH)
     - bug that showed when you did CLEAR then immediately ^L, this was
       related to double status line (reported by BiGhEaD)
     - autoreply saving for new users
     - crash on REDIRECT =nick when there was no active chat connection with
       nick
     - userlist number when adding new users
     - channel synch, it wasn't printed if either 315 (end of who) or 368
       (end of bans) numerics were hooked
     - problem when output line with ANSI colors needed to be split up,
       original EPIC code did it wrong
     - DIRLM using message with ANSI colors, we now remove ANSI crap
     - ADDF adding wrong mask in certain cases
     - ADDFCHAN when removing channel from channel list (reported by arc)
     - attempt has been made to fix DCCs, I hope it helps (thanks panasync)
     - fixed ADDFFLAG reporting wrong number of changed entries
     - general fixes/additions to OperVision. It's still not completed, but
       it is usable. Send any problem reports to Zakath <xanth@magg.net>
       There is a possibility that HOOKS will be added to OV for all of you
       scripters (thanks to gemini for testing)
     - fixed NWHOIS (Usage  /NICKST <nick>) (reported by neuronik)
     - fixed AutoReply bug when you were away (it would echo the save
       string on your screen with ^J character) (reported by neuronik/kao/PeLe) 
     - mode change -l-o nick crash fixed (reported by ACiDFlaSH, heavily
       abused by ZED and Sheik 8)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ScrollZ v1.8b, 1st of January, 1997

  Added:
     - we now have a home page for ScrollZ :). It is hosted on 3 machines,
       URLs are :
       http://www.metalfan.com/scrollz
       http://bbs.eui.upv.es/scrollz
       http://fear.3sheep.com/scrollz (not working at the moment)
     - SET MAX_WALLOP_NICKS to set maximum number of nicks per wallop message
       because some servers limit this number (suggested by stoned)
     - CDCC QUEUE to report queue status, do SHELP CDCC QUEUE for more info
     - couple of parameters to NET, do SHELP NET for more info
     - Zakath has added OperVision to client (compile with -DOPERVISION)

       from channel list for userlist entries (suggested by Aut0psy)
     - we got new doc file by PitLord (it's on the home page)
     - BITCH mode, when set to on, only people from userlist are allowed
       to be channel operators (requested by ACiDFlaSH)

       ADDFFLAG and ADDFCHAN (requested by ACiDFlaSH)

  Changed:
     - improved ctcp flood routines, if you SET NO_CTCP_FLOOD to non-zero
       value, only one CTCP reply will be sent per line
     - changed DCC queueing, it should work as advertised, sending up to
       Cdcc limit DCCs at a time. You can get arround this by using DCC SEND
       instead.
     - moved CDCC RENPACK to -DEXTRAS
     - CDCC PLIST and CDCC NOTICE
     - NEWUSER -s is gone
     - scatter kicks are back if you define SCKICKS

       file size reasonable (full history is available on ScrollZ home page)
     - updated help for ADDBK (thanks mathe)
     - reworked protection scheme, user must have U privilege for client to
       protect him/her from bans. The same is true for deops, users needs O

     - God users can spread ops if bitch mode is on (suggested by ACiDFlaSH)

  Fixed:
     - lag-o-meter for lame 2.9 servers (reported by JustMe_)
     - crash on BYE when LOAD_PATH points to wrong dir
     - loading of Cdcc limit and idle, idle had default value, value for limit
       was actually idle value from ScrollZ.save
     - CDCC NOTICE, it did nothing at all
     - Cdcc now works via MSG (only Cdcc list worked so far)
     - permanent user mode, it should be set on every connect to server now
     - number of messages on status bar should now be ok, even when you

       lines that should be printed before pause
     - channel mode not being updated in hidden windows when you join channel
     - ^k won't mess up your status bar anymore (thanks neuronik)
     - people will be opped when you receive channel operator status on join
       if they have AUTO-OP access (even if they are protected, pointed out by
       ACiDFLaSH)
     - $color(), it now clears all colors set by previous color command so bold
       won't affect further output (thanks neuronik)
     - SHELP prompts now work as advertised (thanks neuronik)
     - crash when you're K-Lined on a server (reported by Jugernaut)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ScrollZ v1.8a, 27th of November, 1996

  Added:
     - added -DNEWCSCAN to defines, so by default you will have old, non
       formatted /CSCAN (requested by neuronik and bunch of other users)
     - added $color() for all scripters out there, it returns internal color
       for event, usage is $color(eventnum colnum), for example $color(3 1)
       returns color3 for MSG and $color(17 5) returns color5 for PUBLIC,
       eventnum is number from 1 to 21 and colnum ranges from 1 to 6. Events
       are ordered in the same way as they are saved in ScrollZ.save
     - /NEWUSER now accepts -s, this tells it not to reconnect to server
       (requested by Rapture)
     - /SET STATUS_CHANNELCOUNT has now been added. Just set this to (%U),
       and then whenever you join a channel, it will pop up on the status
       bar as (O:57 N:38 T:95) (Coded by Zakath)
     - SZdist to make life easier for distro team

  Changed:
     - changed protection levels, protected users will now be deopped if they
       deop/ban/kick gods and they won't be reopped/unbanned/reinvited if god
       deops/bans/kicks them (requested by ACiDFlaSH)
     - changed colors for kick: color6 is for friends, color1 is for others
     - moved /DOBANS to -DEXTRAS
     - new default color scheme
     - /CDBAN, /LK, /MDOP and /MOP are now much faster, sending as much stuff
       to server as possible in one line (great idea by mikh)
     - changed character for /ME, I like it a lot more
     - client will delay next change to original nick for 500 seconds if you
       manually change nick (requested by mathe)
     - optimized protection routines to send all possible mode undos in as few
       lines as possible
     - when compiling with -DACID, users will be invited on notify signon even
       if channel is not +i
     - /AWAYSAVE now accepts -, ie. /AWAYSAVE -DCC will remove dcc from saving.
       Also note that effects accumulate so if you do /AWAYSAVE NONE, /AWAYSAVE
       MSG and /AWAYSAVE NOTICE, both MSGs and NOTICEs will be saved
       (idea by mathe)
     - STATUS_USER has been redone. Now, STATUS_USER=%!00, STATUS_USER1=%!01,
       STATUS_USER19 = %!19, etc. There are only 20 STATUS_USER variables
       (0-19), hope that is enough. %U, %X, %Y & %Z have been removed, and
       the old %! has been moved to %U (Coded by Zakath)
     - /SET STATUS_AWAY has been changed- now just set it to <Away:%A> or
       whatever, and %A will be filled in by your away-message-count
       (Coded by Zakath)
     - /VERSION has been changed slightly - it now shows which options your
       client was compiled with. Client: ircII 2.8.2 + ScrollZ v1.8 [AHeKT]
       A/a = Ansi   H/h = High ascii  E/e = Extras  K/k = On_kick
       T/t = Timers OV = OperVision (not enabled yet)   
       Custom user modes (fet, GenX, acid, etc.. are not shown here)
       (Coded by Zakath)

  Fixed:
     - client will send reop only if protected user was opped before deop
       (pointed out by Zakath)

     - /CTCP your_nick WHOAMI will now show all entries to person that asked
       for it (reported by ACiDFlaSH)
     - fixed whowas crashing on /ADDF and /ADDBK (reported by ACiDFlaSH)
     - fixed /LISTF and /LISTBK not displaying the actual number for entry
       (reported by JustMe_)
     - fixed /SHOWUSER crash with non synched channels (reported by ACiDFlaSH)
     - client will ignore requests for INVITE, OP, UNBAN, ... via CTCP if it
       comes to a channel, like /CTCP #channel INVITE
     - fixed typo in /AUTOINV, it always said it was turned ON even if you did
       turn it OFF. It worked, just the output was wrong. Loading of AUTOINV
       has been fixed too. (reported by mathe, noHUP and Rapture)
     - /DESCRIBE now goes to correct window
     - fixed bug when protected users' info was stored in whowas buffer
     - fixed /FE, it won't crash anymore as it did with stock client (reported
       by gemini/neuronik)
     - number of messages in away file now resets when you /REMLOG (reported
       by noHUP)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Added:
     - added whowas that was donated to me last year by Mr. coding wizard
       (that's Sheik in case you didn't know :P), this kinda makes
       client the real thing in his opinion
     - added F flag to friend privileges, such users will not trigger flood
       protection
     - you can now enter 'c' for continuous mode on all prompts for next

  Changed:
     - /AUTOCOMPL now accepts optional second argument, so you can customize
       auto reply look (idea from anss.irc)
     - improved flood routines (with a bit of help from Epic)
     - added check for CTCP flood. Flood rates are HALF of normal ones
       because CTCP floods can be pain in the ass
     - /SET NO_CTCP_FLOOD now holds delay in seconds before next CTCP is
       processed, if set to 0 CTCP requests will be parsed as they
       come in
     - /FINGER user@host now works (requested by Ahnberg)
     - /FK now accepts nick!user@host filter (requested by ACiDFlaSH)
     - redone /CSCAN, it now lists people in hierarchical order if you pass
       -H as first argument. Order is : shitlisted people, normal users,
       voiced users, ops, friends. If -R is passed as first argument, it
       will list users in reversed hierarchical order, with friends coming
       first and shitlisted people showing up last. Old style will be used
       if no arguments are given. Also color6 will be used for shitlisted
       people. (requested by anitrate)
     - changed atmosphere (/ME) format (requested by neuronik)
     - protected users will be unbanned regardless of whether they are in
       channel or not (actually this works like in CtoolZ, it will work if
       they are on channel or their info is stored in whowas list)
     - from now on, client will NOT check for ban on you anymore, if you
       want this add yourself with prot level. I didn't change this beacuse
       Sheik bitched but because it makes client faster and smaller. This
       also means some logs in ScrollZ.away won't have the same look and
       feel as before
     - messages telling you that protected user has been deopped/banned/
       kicked are gone
     - removed /TAG, /WHEREIS and /WHERELIST because no one uses them
     - removed scatter kicks (read ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ for reason)
     - /NOIG now accepts filter (you can also use it like /IGNORE *@*com none)
     - from now on, client will load file szglobal instead of global because
       global is script that comes with ircII 2.8.2 and hooks up /LUSERS,
       /STATS and some other replies
     - changed colors for join: color5 is for friends, color1 is for normal
       users, color6 is for shitted people
     - changed colors for leave/quit: color4 is for friends, color1 is for
       normal people, color 5 is for shitted people
     - changed colors for notify: color6 is for friends, color1 is for
       normal people on signon/signoff
     - all DCC addons are back
     - removed /CTCP idle hack, from now client will send message to channel
       #noidlechannel every 500 seconds
     - added new DEF for compile. -DEXTRAS can be used to compile ScrollZ
       with the following commands, most of which are not used on a 
       regular basis (knocks 7-10K off of stripped client size):
        - /AUTOINV      - Invites on Notify     - /LOGO
        - /FIND         - /SVER                 - /BKT
        - /DIRLMK       - /DIRLNK               - /BKI
        - /MODELOCK     - /MODEUNLOCK           - Mode Lock Checking
        - /LLOOKUP      - /LLOOK                - /RANLK
        - /MN           - /ML                   - /CHOPS
       If something has been added to this list that you absolutly cannot
       live without, or something isn't in the above list that you feel
       should be, contact Flier or Zakath. (DEF by Zakath)
     - -DLINUXUSER has been moved to -DHIGHASCII. Below are all DEFS
       recognizable by the source:
        HIGHASCII       Compile w/ high ascii
        WANTANSI        Compile w/ ANSI colors and support
        HAVETIMEOFDAY   If you have gettimeofday() (most systems do)
        ON_KICK         ON_KICK hooks enabled (disabled by default)
        EXTRAS          Compile w/ miscellaneous commands enabled, read above
        BETTERTIMER     More accurate timer (needs HAVETIMEOFDAY, not working)
        GENX            GenX's nitfy whois - different appearance
        FET             Prints friend info after server in WHOIS
       Edit defs.h in include dir to change defaults.
     - /SHOWUSER now accepts nick!user@host type of filter

  Fixed:
     - fixed /TKILL for servers that return username in /TRACE reply
     - fixed automatic nick change, I guess some of you have wondered how
       did you end up being Nickname or Nickname_
     - fixed crash on BSD when you said no to 'Display message file'
       (reported by PitLord)
     - fixed bug in %!, it didn't update correctly when someone left
       channel (found and fixed by JustMe_)
     - fixed bug in DCC status when reget/resend wasn't established yet
     - fixed extra space in $J (reported by neuronik)
     - you could be flashed by BitchX users, it won't work anymore (thanks
       panasync)
     - your publics won't trigger auto reply anymore
     - nickname you received chat message from is now moved to first position
       in tabkey list
     - crash when client detected flood from server (reported by Zakath)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ScrollZ v1.7i, 10th of October, 1996

  Added:
     - percentage of file read is shown on /SETBACK (suggested by JustMe_)
     - added %! status variable, it will tell you number of ops, noops
       and total number of people on current channel (requested
       by IceMan)
     - added $J which holds current ScrollZ version (1.7i for example)
       by popular demand
     - added public counter for all nicks

  Changed:
     - /P without args will ping current channel (suggested by IceMan)
     - /VER without args will request version for current channel
       (suggested by IceMan)
     - client now pings server every minute to measure lag, this has also
       fixed the bug with scripts reporting that you have pinged yourself
       (reported by BiGhEaD)
     - /FKILL has been renamed to /WKILL, it has been rehauled too, you
       must pass it filter for WHO and pattern for KILL now
     - /SHOWUSER will now show users on current channel by default
     - banned users that join channel will only be kicked if /KICKONBAN
       is on for that channel (requested by fet)
     - all DCC addons (queueing, status bar variables and minimum speed
       check) have been temporarily removed (they'll be back when I figure
       out reason for stalled DCCs)
     - %J status variable now holds DCC type too (S=send, s=resend, G=get,
       g=reget) (read above)
     - check for idle DCCs is now done every minute
     - renamed /NICKST to /NWHOIS
     - optimized protection routines, they're now faster and produces less
       output

  Fixed:
     - when someone did /MSG yournick CDCC LIST client crashed (sorry for
       this nasty bug)
     - fixed URL catcher problem where public/msg was displayed in wrong
       window
     - fixed /WINDOW BIND, it actually works now and also accepts comma
       separated list of channels so you can bind more than one
       channel to window
     - channel related output now goes to correct window
     - nick completion with only two users on channel inserted other nick
      if line started with : (reported by brickman)
     - fixed formatting in /SHOWUSER with your friends not being +o or +v
     - /CDCC GET fixed with files offered in REGET mode

ScrollZ v1.7h, 30th of September, 1996

  Added:
     - CHAT level to /AWAYSAVE (requested by Brickman)
     - /MAP to list a map of all servers (requested by jimmie)
     - D flag to shitlist, such users will be deopped if opped
       (requested by jimmie and ACiDFlaSH)
     - detection of gettimeofday() and Linux to configure, so if you
       want to change defines, include/defs.h is the place to do it

  Changed:
     - loading of global is back (requested by jimmie)
     - /DCC is back, but without args, list of dccs will be shown as in
       /CDCC (I think this is what users wanted)
     - lastjoin will now show CHANNEL_NAME_WIDTH characters for channel
       name
     - /CHAT and /NOCHAT without arguments will initiate/close chat
       connection respectively with last user to request it
       (requested by Brickman)
     - new nicer whois for high ascii client, I got it from neuronik
       though I think fizz was the author

  Fixed:
     - permanent ban that was enforced on all channels
       (reported by ACidFLaSH)
     - /DOBANS, it didn't set all bans of shit types PB and BKI
     - /ADDBK, it didn't report wrong usage if shit type was wrong
     - /TKILL, I hope it works now
     - rather nasty bug that sometimes crashed client when someone
       did /CTCP your_nick CDCC LIST
     - problem with too long status lines
     - problem with scrolling input prompt (reported by neuronik and
       panasync :))

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ScrollZ v1.7g, 23rd of September, 1996

  Added:
     - added new shit level, PB, it stands for permanent ban, ie. if someone
       clears this ban and you are opped client will enforce ban
       (requested by ACidFLaSH)
     - /CSCAN is now formatted (suggested by quantex)
     - you can now ignore channels, usage is /IGNORE #channel level where
       level can be : PUBLIC, CRAP or CTCP
     - permanent user mode in ScrollZ.save, add something like USERMODE +is
       to your ScrollZ.save (requested by neuronik)
     - /TIMER now accepts floating arguments, this makes possible to time
       events more accurately and even delays of less than a second are
       possible, you have to define -DHAVETIMEOFDAY and -DBETTERTIMER to get
       this to work (requested by anitrate)
     - /SVER added to show the world what you are using :P
     - /TKILL which stands for trace kill (requested by Prophet and Zaphon)

  Changed:
     - ignored nicks/userhosts are not converted to uppercase because that
       was really annoying
     - client will report when someone does /CTCP #channel Cdcc blah
       (requested by neuronik)
     - invite on notify will invite user only if he doesn't have a password
       set (pointed out by JustMe_)
     - the same is true for auto-op (pointed out by JustMe_)
     - blah: auto nick completion changed, it will now ignore your nickname
       when doing the completion (suggested by brickman)
     - renamed /DCC to /OLDCC, /CDCC is now the same as /DCC
       (requested by poseidon)
     - nicknames can now be 15 characters long for AlterNet servers
       (requested by TC)

  Fixed:
     - fixed nick completion that choked in a very special ocasion
       (reported by JustMe_)
     - fixed problem when closing idle dcc chats (reported by neuronik)
     - if you send DCC requests to someone that is not on irc, client will
       automatically remove such requests from DCC list (suggested by
       neuronik)
     - when you're K-lined from a server, client will reconnect only if you
       have other servers on server list (I hope this removes the bug
       with client crashing on K-line, reported by Jugernaut)
     - fixed /LISTF, it always listed users who had * in list of channels.
       It now checks channels only if pattern starts with # (reported by
       JustMe_)
     - fixed /JOIN -INVITE to behave like join if you already are on a
       channel you have been invited to, this one is from the stock client
       (reported by neuronik)
     - yet another bug with ANSI in input prompt fixed (reported by JustMe_)
     - /LISTF and /LISTBK now list real numbers so /REMF and /REMBK # will
       remove correct entry if you pass them that number (reported by JustMe_)
     - /SAVE will now save to ~/.scrollzrc by default plus notify nicks
       won't be saved unless explicitly requested (suggested by brickman)
     - /DIGRAPH -ADD now actually works, this was another stupid bug from
       stock client

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ScrollZ v1.7f, 11th of September, 1996

  Added:
     - SZsetup to set-up colours interactively, it kicks butt :))
     - ANSI to status bar (coded by JustMe_)
     - /SET STATUS_REVERSE ON or OFF will toggle reverse status bar on or
       off (because colorized status bar looks ugly in reverse)
     - you can now bind tabkey stuff to any key you want to, command name is
       insert_tabkey
     - /MULTK will kick nick from multiple channels (requested by fLaSh)
     - default kick comments are now saved into ScrollZ.save
     - /FKILL will do /WHO then kill all users WHO returns (requested by
       Prophet)
     - /SET MAX_MODES to set maximum number of modes client will send in one
       line for those lame 2.9 servers
     - /LOGO is back because anitrate spiced up the ansi even more and it
       deserves the chance to display it when you want :)
     - added another color to all events, we needed this to avoid the mess,
       this will generate errors on first startup, just do /SVE
     - virtual host patch coded by TC, do export IRCHOST="host" to utilize it
     - client will auto-invite people you have on notify list if channel is +i
       and their privileges include INVITE, CHOPS, OP and UNBAN (suggested by
       ACiDFlaSH)
     - /AUTOCOMPL toggles nick completion on public messages on or off. This
       works like in sCZ!tE, do /SHELP AUTOCOMPL for more info (requested by
       neuronik and ACiDFlaSH)

  Changed:
     - /SET _SCROLLZ_STRING has been renamed to SCROLLZ_STRING
     - nick completion (default bind is ^T) will now do nick completion at
       current cursor position, not only at the beginning of input line
     - noHUP fixed -DGENX to comply with settings for normal client
     - /COLOR COLSETTING w/o arguments will report current status (suggested by
       noHUP)
     - /CHANST is now internal so it's fast like hell :)
     - last message will be stored in long format no matter what /EXTMES is
       set to (requested by neuronik)
     - client will now print whether topic was set/unset <G>
     - /SHOWUSER will now show privilege (requested by thanos and ACiDFlaSH)

  Fixed:
     - ^W# works again (reported by jimmie)
     - /ADDF will now add another entry for user if channels field differs
       from existing entries for that user (it did behave like this from
       the day I wrote it but I fucked it up when I added support for list
       of channels it's valid on, reported by fLaSh)
     - all CTCPs now supress output if /SET VERBOSE_CTCP is set to off
     - tilde cloaking problem when using cursors
     - /DIRLSM didn't work as it should (reported by Jugernaut)
     - /DIRLM and /DIRLSM are now low ascii

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ScrollZ v1.7e, 26th of August, 1996

  Added:
     - new kickass logo by anitrate
     - BKI level to ADDBK, it will also ignore the person you just
       bankicked (suggested by mathe)
     - Join flag to ADDF, when someone w/ this flag invites you to channel,
       client will join that channel no matter what /AJOIN is set to
       (requested by mathe)
     - list of all available user/shit levels, do /SHELP LEVELS
     - /LOGON ON will save to ScrollZ.away even if you're not setaway
       (requested by Wobba)
     - names on join are now colored using colors from CSCAN, note that it is
       impossible to distinguish friends from others since we don't have all
       the info we need to do so at that point, so only ops/+v/others are
       colored (requested by mathe)
     - %J is new status variable, it holds DCC status (requested by noHup and
       mathe). This slows down transfers considerably plus CPU usage gets 
       rather high if you're on ethernet so I added /CDCC STATUS setting to
       turn this on/off.
     - fix for chat messages larger than 1024 bytes, this should stop lame
       /DCCCRASH from BitchX :)
     - support for F-keys, all 12 keys work on Linux, usage is /BIND F1 blah
       where F1 can be replaced with F1 through F12. Note that screen binds
       strange sequences to F1-F5 by default and you need to modify .screenrc
       to make it work (you can mail Flier if you need it). Home won't work
       anymore since keys F6-F12 share the same meta sequence with it, because
       of this F10 won't work with screen either (mail Flier for hacked screen
       that fixes this and also supports high ascii client compiled with
       -DLINUXUSER)

  Changed:
     - ADDBK levels must now be typed in as K, BK or BKI, they will be reported
       as that in $checkshit() too
     - ^U is bound to erase_line again, F2 will join last channel you have been
       invited to
     - F1 is bound to /SHELP KEYS now
     - if /CDCC IDLE is set to 0, it is disabled
     - TIMEOFDAY define has been renamed to HAVETIMEOFDAY because AIX
       already has such a define

  Fixed:
     - bug in input line when ansi characters were in input_prompt and you
       were typing characters in the middle of the input line
     - when you were +v'ed client set the flag you were opped too (I wish
       that was true :)) (reported by GenX/mathe). If your status_chanop
       includes @ it will be replaced with + in that case
     - client won't autoget files with length zero
     - DCCs with handshake different than IP where it's coming from will
       also be ignored (pointed out by Zakath & ZED)
     - bug that fucked up exec when DCCs were active

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ScrollZ v1.7d, 19th of August, 1996

  Note  : Might be a good idea to /SVE after you've loaded your 
          ScrollZ.save file. This version (1.7d) is the 1.7c
          release with patches by Zakath, mainly for bug testing
          purposes.
          Ok, I added a few fixes/addons too  -Flier
  Added :
     - /REPWORD allows you to change your AutoReply Buffer while on
       IRC. Changes made with /REPWORD *will* be saved in as normal
       in the ScrollZ.save file (coded by Zakath)
     - 6 new status bar variables. Here is complete listing of status
       variables included in the client (coded by Zakath):
          %1 = Uptime
          %2 = Lag Timer
          %3 = Last join
          %4 = No. packs offered (/CDcc Offer)
          %5 = No. of current DCC Sends
          %6 = No. of current DCC Gets
          %7 = /Cdcc AutoGet On/Off              [A/a]           *new*
          %8 = /Cdcc Secure On/Off               [S/s]           *new*
          %D = /FRList On/Off                    [F/f]           *new*
          %L = /CTCPCloak Hide/On/Off            [H/K/k]         *new*
          %P = /FloodP On/Off                    [P/p]           *new*
          %E = /NHProt On/Off Quiet/Medium/Full  [Nq/nm/Nf/...]  *new*
     - /URL has been implemented, if you see a URL you wish to save, type
       /URL, and you will be prompted from there /SHELP URL for more info.
       This is true when URLCATCH is set to ON, if it is set to AUTO,
       client will still automatically save all URLs (coded by Zakath)
     - support for g and n usermodes (actually by Zakath)
     - /ADDF now accepts optional password as the last argument, usage is
       also a bit different because of that (requested by neuronik)

  Changed :
     - /LISTF now supports channels to search your userlistings. /LISTF #s*
       for instance would show you all of your friends with access in
       channels that started with "s". (patched by Zakath)
     - /AJOIN has new syntax:  [auto/on channels] or [off]
       If the first arg is "auto", the client will attempt to join channels
       when you're SetAway. "on" will just join channels on invite only.
     - When your away, status_away will display # of logged messages since
       you /SetAway - i.e. if STATUS_AWAY_VAR is set to "ZZZZZZ" , then
       %A will equal "ZZZZZZ:3"  (patched by Zakath)
     - When URL is detected in PUBLIC, it will appear bolded..
       <Lamer> http://blah.com etc..   (patched by Zakath)
     - If you change your nick and the desired nick is already in use,
       client will tell you who is using the nick. (requested by hauffer)
     - /CDCC AutoGet is now defaulted to OFF (requested and explained by EA)
     - Many of the colors have been changed. To find out which color settings
       do what, read the ScrollZ.color file.
     - /LIST and /NAMES without parameters will warn you and do nothing
       (requested by neuronik)
     - I fucked up with binding ^O to join last channel you have been invited
       to, ^O turns bold, reverse and underline off, so new bind is ^U

  Fixed :
     - /AWAYT 0 did not work properly. Now, if value is 0, AutoAway
       is disabled (reported by hauffer & EA)
     - Added DEC Alpha support to term.h (patch supplied by Zaphon)
     - bug related to /WINDOW DOUBLE it can be found in BitchX/ircII 2.9 too
       (reported by JustMe_)
     - bug in initial auto reply setting for new users
     - client always loaded ~/.scrollzrc if it was present, ignoring -l and -L
       switches on command line
     - ansi in INPUT_PROMPT fucked up input line on some occasions when using
       backspace/delete (reported by neuronik)
     - your public messages did not increase number of publics in channel

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ScrollZ v1.7c, 9th of August, 1996

  Added :
     - support for ansi in /SET INPUT_PROMPT, good input prompt might look
       something like \[1;36m$C\[0m> (requested by anitrate)
     - ^O will now join last channel you have been invited to (suggested
       by jimmie)
     - ^K is bound to lastjoiner_kick, it will ban kick last person to join
       from current channel
     - /EGO on/off to print your nick in publics in different color, color is
       taken from COLNOTICE color2 (requested by Prophet)
     - ^N is bound to accept_last_chat, it will establish DCC chat connection
       with user that has last requested chat connection
     - client will now search for .scrollzrc first, if that fails it will
       search for .ircrc (suggested by panasync)
     - new colour scheme in ScrollZ.scheme from JustMe_
     - try /SHELP KEYS, but don't forget to copy new ScrollZ.help first

  Changed :
     - /CDCC now accept abbreviations just like normal client commands (ie.
       you can do /CDCC SE instead of /CDCC SEND)
     - LASTLOG_LEVEL is now ALL by default
     - LASTLOG is now 1000 by default
     - /CLEARKEY has been renamed to /NOKEY
     - /LK won't kick +v'ed users

  Fixed :
     - when compiling with -DLINUXUSER client will automatically enable eight
       bit characters, set translation to LATIN_1 and echo ^[(U to support
       high ascii
     - %5 is dcc sends and %6 is dcc gets in status bar, not opposite as
       noted few lines down :P
     - send queue works now (at least I think it does)
     - bug in saving notify entries

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ScrollZ v1.7b, 1st of August, 1996

  Added :
     - new look for client, I took Zakath's TooLie box as an example plus
       Zakath coded some things
     - if you want extended PC characters in MSG and LINKS add define
       -DLINUXUSER to top Makefile
     - /WINDOW DOUBLE to toggle double status bar for every single window
     - Control-F is now bound to /WHOLEFT by default
     - /NTFYMODE to toggle brief/verbose notify mode
     - /PINGME to ping yourself
     - /CDCC REQUEST to tell leechers what you need (coded by Zakath)
     - three new status variables, %4 shows number of offered packs, %5 shows
       number of active GET/REGET DCC connections and %6 shows number of
       active SEND/RESEND DCC connections (coded by Zakath)
     - /NOTEPAD to save text to file (coded by Zakath)
     - URL grabber, it grabs lines containing ftp:/ and http:/, /NOTEPAD is
       used to save URLs, command is /URLCATCH (requested by EC)
     - ^T is bound to nick_completion, it takes current input line and tries
       to find nick starting with that line, much like tab in bash or tcsh
       (suggested by EC)

  Changed :
     - /LISTN and /WHOLEFT are now more compact (suggested by Zakath)
     - new default colour scheme

  Fixed :
     - bug with /SET LOAD_PATH that sneaked in sometimes (found out by
       JustMe_)
     - lastjoin didn't get updated if you hooked ON JOIN
     - messages and notices were not saved to ScrollZ.away if you hooked ON MSG
       and ON NOTICE respectively (reported by Zakath)
     - the same was true for auto reply saving
     - /CSCAN would crash on channels with huge number of people sitting in
       (thanks dm)
     - bug in netsplit routine (*.se *.fi signoff wasn't considered as split)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ScrollZ v1.7a, 15th of July, 1996

  Added :
     - /SET _SCROLLZ_STRING to replace [S+Z] if you don't like it

  Fixed :
     - bug in $read(), it didn't return error in some cases it should
     - bug in window routine that didn't set window's channel as it should
       be and messed window levels, this bug is also found in CtoolZ/BitchX
       cause Sheik coded this to fix another bug but he overlooked this one
       (reported by JustMe_ and Zakath)
     - client crashed when you killed window that you set for conversation
       with someone using /WINDOW ADD (found by JustMe_)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

       Metalfan)
     - client will now return status of 152 when you exit with /TERMINATE
       or five CTRL-Cs and 0 otherwise (requested by MGS)
     - new ban type, Elite, it functions like better ban but bans user with
       bunch of ? characters in ban string (requested by xtract)
     - if you use ORIGNICK, add your nick to notify list and client will swi-
       tch to original nick as soon as it detects sign off for the person
       using your nick

  Changed :
     - if /CDCC SECURE is ON, client will auto get only files from people that
       have Cdcc privilege (requested by Uhus)
     - first dcc speed check is now done after 15 seconds
     - uptime looks much nicer now
     - your own lines won't trigger auto reply

  Fixed :
     - changed code a lot, this made client smaller and I hope it won't crash
       on Solaris anymore
     - client now handles IP numbers correctly (finally :))
     - client dumped core when you received notice from x@services.us or did
       /CONNECT because userhost was NULL (reported by stoned & Zakath)
     - dcc reget/resend now show correct file transfer status (percentage
       completed and bytes received/sent)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ScrollZ v1.6i, 3rd of June, 1996

  Added :
     - /REMF and /REMBK #filter is now possible, where filter is the same as
       in Cdcc and /TBAN (suggested by Zakath)
     - /ADDF and /ADDBK will now add * as the nick (requested by many people)

       plus they're colored now - colors for nicks are taken from colors for
       CSCAN (new color setting) (requested by GenX)

  Changed :
     - auto nick changing when we get nickname in use from server, I borrowed
       some pieces of code from BitchX (suggested by MoebiusX)
     - some minor internal changes
     - removed initial lag that was caused by having people on notify list,
       this was a problem with stock client

     - bug in loading ScrollZ.save in NHPROT (reported by MoebiusX)

       by JustMe_)
     - bug in QUERY that crashed client (found out by JustMe_, I don't use
       QUERY at all so I couldn't figure this one)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ScrollZ v1.6h, 20th of May, 1996

  Added :
     - /DIRLM and /DIRLN will now add nick to Tab list too (idea by noHup)
     - synch time is now printed on channel synch
     - /ADDW now accepts comment (requested by despair)
     - /REMLOG will delete ScrollZ.away file (requested by kero)

  Changed :
     - auto reply now activates on *your_nick* not your_nick*
     - ^R will now cycle through last five nicks that activated auto reply
     - /CTCP your_nick CDCC HELP could easily excess flood you off the net
       (thanks to noHup), so I've changed it a bit to prevent this
     - /LISTF format (requested by Zakath)
     - $checkuser will return privilege like /FIND reports it
       (format is level user@host channels)
     - $checkshit will return K for kick or BK for bankick
       (format is level user@host channels reason)

  Fixed :
     - ALL privilege didn't work in /ADDF (bug reported by noHup)
     - you could crash client with huge numbers in /CDCC IDLE PTIME LIMIT
       (reported by noHup)
     - PING times were not always correct + there was a bug in lag meter
       (Wobba, you were right about this one :))
     - /CSCAN[some spaces here] would crash client (thanks No1, or whoever
       found this one though I believe you were on drugs to dig this one out
       as already pointed out by noHup :P)
     - ETA was printed negative if file size was smaller than what we have
       actually received/sent (it's now printed as N/A)
     - all my $ functions now return -1 on error (thanks Zakath)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ScrollZ v1.6g, 14th of May, 1996

  Added :
     - ^R will now insert the nick of the user that last triggered your auto
        reply buffer (function name is INSERT_AUTOREPLY)

     - /DUMP to dump VARs ALIASes ONs or ALL (requested by Zakath)
     - $stripansi() for CtoolZ compatibility
     - $checkuser(nick!user@host channel) will return string of form :
       level aop prot filter chan_filter or -1 on error
     - $checkshit(nick!user@host channel) will return string of form :
       level filter chan_filter reason or -1 on error
       (both of above requested by Zakath, they're semi CtoolZ compatible)
       btw, here's a list of my add-ons :
       $open(file R/W), $write(file text), $read(file), $close(file),
       $eof(file) and $rename(oldfile newfile) for compatibilty with CtoolZ
       $uh(nick) will return internal userhost info for nick or 0 if
       not found

  Changed :
     - client now accepts (U sequence (it turns on extended PC chars, this
       creates opportunity for scripts to look better on Linux)
     - ON KICK now works (requested by strahd)

  Fixed :
     - lastjoin got updated on netjoins too (pointed out by JustMe_)
     - /FIND didn't print V(ote) privilege
     - a few prints in CTCP area
     - a bug in saving CDCC LIST requests
     - /CDCC PTIME 0 didn't work (it should disable PLIST output, bug reported
       by Zakath)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ScrollZ v1.6f, 1st of May, 1996

  Added :
     - /FKLINE, it will show only K-lines matching filter (requested by GenX)
     - /C, it is like /MODE #current_chan chanmode
     - new userlevel, it's called VOTE - it is delayed like autoop (I guess
       you all know why we need this one, requested by GenX)
     - new status format variable, %3 holds lastjoin (suggested by PiC9)
     - AUTOREPLY setting in ScrollZ.save (it sets autoreply buffer, you can
       set multiple entries, like in Nick1,Dude)
     - /NSLOOKUP, I guess you know what it does (requested by BlueBalls)

  Changed :
     - client now supports cursor keys, PgUp, PgDown, Home and End without
       messing with binds in .ircrc, client will also strip the ~ char that
       showed when you pressed some of those keys (requested by GenX)
     - /SHELP has changed again, it now accepts filter (meaning you can do
       /SHELP *KICK*)
     - new /CDCC PLIST look by spsycho
     - lots of /SETs that needed to be defined in .ircrc are now obsolete
       (such as DISPLAY_ANSI, HIDE_PRIVATE_CHANNELS, ...)
     - input buffer is now four times the size of what it used to be
       (suggested by BlueBalls)

  Fixed :
     - /IGNORE said it will only ignore for /IGTIME seconds whereas it really
       ignored forever (I meant it to be that way, I just didn't bother to fix
       the print line)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ScrollZ v1.6e, 23rd of April, 1996

  Added :
     - ETA added to /CDCC (suggested by despair)
     - coloured and better looking /links (suggested by clavo)
     - /PLAYBACK will show ScrollZ.away file w/o marking you as
       not being away (requested by JustMe_)
     - Signoff is now colored, colors are taken from join
     - SHOWWALLOP - if set to off, client will not show nicks who are
       being walloped, note that this setting can be changed via
       ScrollZ.save only (requested by despair)

  Changed :
     - client now has ability to define what to save (MSGs, NOTICEs,
       mass modes, collisions, protection abusement, nethacks, ...)
       Type /SHELP AWAYSAVE (idea by MGS)
     - /SHELP will now search for substring, ie. you can do /SHELP KICK
       now and client will print help for all commands starting with KICK
     - revamped reconnect to server, client will now try to connect every
       minute (traversing through server list)

  Fixed :
     - when chat request was received from user, client didn't add his nick
       to TAB list (it only added his nick to list if you requsted chat)
     - client wouldn't delete ScrollZ.away if it was in some other directory
       than current directory (bug reported by JustMe_)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ScrollZ v1.6d, 1st of April, 1996

  Added :
     - client will now accept XDCC as well as CDCC (requested by art3mis)
     - send queue for pending files when limit is reached (art3mis again)
     - new setting, KICKONBAN, default is on for all channels, if off, client
       won't kick the person that banned you (jami just for you)
     - Cdcc color setting
     - from now on, client will load all of its internal files from path specified
       in LOAD_PATH variable - default includes current dir (as client has functioned
       till now), but you can change it to any dir of your choice (this makes it
       more flexible, you can have more configurations for the client active when
       combined with -l and -L switches described a few lines down). If you unset
       this variable (/SET -LOAD_PATH) current dir will be used. Please note that if
       you specify multiple paths in LOAD_PATH (as in ~/.ScrollZ:~/irc), only first
       one will be used for saving files (ScrollZ.save and ScrollZ.away), while any
       path is valid for loading (thanks to BiGHeaD for this useful tip)
     - signed on reply in /WHOIS for servers that support it (I think AlterNet does,
       so it's a good reason to implement it anyway)

  Changed :
     - when you do /SETAWAY and /SETBACK client will display message at the
       end of the string (ScrollZ - LOG ON or ScrollZ - LOG OFF) (I didn't
       know iCePiK is so proud of my client :>)
     - fixed configure script so it now produces Makefile with WANTANSI and
       TIMEOFDAY defines already added in. Remember, if you don't won't ANSI
       support and/or more accurate PING, remove those two defines from Makefile
       in root dir of the source
     - fixed configure so client now accepts -l and -L switches - those two are
       for loading some other files instead of .ircrc (thanks to BiGHeaD for
       reminding me)
     - renamed /WKICKOPS to /KICKOPS (change it in ScrollZ.save!!)
     - filter kick will now kick channel operators if /KICKOPS set to ON
     - new kick ass logo by despair
     - new color scheme done by JustMe_ (I like new one, if you wanna give it a try,
       remove all color entries from your ScrollZ.save)

  Fixed :
     - bug when received message has %number in it is now fixed (found by MGS)
     - when Cdcc security was on, it was still possible to see your offered
       list of files when initiated via MSG (/msg your_nick cdcc list)
     - couple of prints

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ScrollZ v1.6c, 18th of March, 1996

   Added :
      - WHO color setting (suggested by iCePiK)
      - WHOIS color setting (suggested by iCePiK)
      - WHOWAS color setting (same as WHOIS)
      - PUBLIC color setting, you can set the color for public messages,
        fourth setting is for auto-reply (when line starts with first three
        characters of your nickname, the nick of the person that sent public
        will be shown in that color)
      - /CDCC CHANNELS, it holds the list of channels where /CDCC PSEND
        should send messages to
      - /CDCC PTIME, it defines how many seconds should pass before client
        should automatically repeat /CDCC PLIST (if you remove packs or
        set PTIME to 0, the action will be disabled) (I think hander wanted
        this)
      - ScrollZ.away and your log file can now be encrypted with /PASSWD (you
        need to know the old password to set new one). I enclosed the decoder,
        it is in file called decode.c so if you're gonna use this be sure
        to compile this one too and don't forget your password! (suggested
        by noHup)
      - some more channel statistics, it is shown on /CHANST
      - when CHAT is established, =nick will be added to TAB list (suggested
        by MoebiusX)
      - /AREJOIN, /DPROT, /FAKE, /KICKONFLOOD, /KPROT, /NHPROT, /NPROT,
        /SHOWAWAY and /WKICKOPS now accept list of channels where the
        apropriate action should be active (like /CSET in Sheik's CToolZ)
      - client will now append CLIENT_INFORMATION to version string 
        (requested by Zakath)

   Changed :
      - /CDCC now accepts command line parameters wherever it is apropriate
        (you can do this now : /CDCC SEND file1.zip file2.zip , nick1 nick2
        where "," differentiates file(s) from nick(s) ). Read help with
        /SHELP CDCC command to get more info
      - /TBAN now accepts filter that acts exactly the same as one in Cdcc
        (requested by MoebiusX)

   Fixed :
      - when you weren't chanop and shitlisted/banned person joined, client
        still tried to do the apropriate action (that's where those You're not
        channel operator notices were coming from)
      - bug in logging, ANSI sequences weren't totally stripped out
      - when DISPLAY_ANSI is OFF, client will strip ANSI codes
      - when banned person joins and is being protected, ban will be removed
      - wordkick only worked on your current channel
      - CDCC will also be accepted via MSG not just via CTCP
      - when you quit IRC with active DCCs, you were warned via message and
        via beep. The latter is now true only if you have /SET BEEP ON
      - bug in /DEOPT, /IGTIME, /KICKT and /NICKT when 0 was passed as
        argument it crashed on some systems (Linux prooved once again how
        good it is :-), digged out by Desys)
      - I hope I fixed all bugs in new Cdcc
      - when reconnecting to server, client didn't send away message to
        server, which efectively marked you as not being away (only client
        had internal info about you being away). This was a bug in original
        client, I thought I fixed that already. Well I hope I really did it
        this time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ScrollZ v1.6b, 12th of February, 1996

   Added :
      - two new color settings (KICK and DCC), do /SVE to save defaults
      - when you get kicked, client will remember key if it was set so it
        can rejoin automatically
      - when marked away, client will try to join channels in /AJOIN ON
        every 500 seconds (channels with * and ? will be ignored)
      - $open(file R/W), $write(file text), $read(file), $close(file),
        $eof(file) and $rename(oldfile newfile) for compatibilty with CtoolZ
      - $uh(nick) will return internal userhost info for nick or -1 if
        not found
      - DCC requests will be saved to when away
      - DCCs other than SEND/RESEND will be auto-closed if not active after
        CDCC IDLE times 3
      - when /CYCLEing, client will use channel key if set

   Changed :
      - client should now be compatible with scripts (I tried it with
        LiCe, PhoEniX and LiTHiuM)
      - some display stuff in Cdcc and CTCP
      - if you ping yourself, lag indicator will be updated
      - rewritten portions of code, making it smaller and faster
      - /SETBACK [reason] works now

   Fixed :
      - CDCC SEND #n works now (made for compatibility with XDCC)
      - ANSI bombs shouldn't affect you (I think it really works now)
      - when you're away and client pings itself message about you being
        away was displayed, it is fixed now
      - IRCUSER variable should work now
      - bug in ADDF that didn't resynch cached pointers to userlist
      - bug in CHANST if DISPLAY_ANSI was on

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ScrollZ v1.6a, 18th of January, 1996

   Added :
      - /UNFLASH if you have mesg -y
      - ANSI color, ripped from EPIC client (client supports commands for 
        color ANSI only to prevent lame ANSI bomb attempts) - "color" was 
        done by JustMe_ (edit Makefile in root dir and add -DWANTANSI to
        DEFS and /SET DISPLAY_ANSI ON if you want to use it, to turn it
        off /SET DISPLAY_ANSI OFF). I've patched screen to support colors,
        if you want it, contact me
      - uPING (it will report ping reply in miliseconds), if you want this
        edit Makefile in root dir and add -DTIMEOFDAY to DEFS. Make sure your
        system supports gettimeofday (easy way to check this is by typing
        man gettimeofday)

   Changed :
      - client will now recognize fake invites
      - if you have EXTMES ON, userhost will also be shown on notices
      - no need to have lex installed, I removed stupid count from Makefile
      - Pooong! will no longer be sent when you're being pinged

   Fixed :
      - new Cdcc kb format (lame HP-UX and IRIX required to fix this)
      - some ScrollZ.save stuff
      - when you did reload, "cached" pointers to userlist were not updated,
        meaning client got the wrong idea of what users privileges are (and
        could crash at worst)
      - ANSI colors were in your log files, they're now removed

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ScrollZ v1.6, 8th of January, 1996

   Added :
      - client should now be faster on lookups for people that are on the
        same channel(s) as you are
      - nick collisions will be saved
      - userhost will be shown on received DCC requests
      - if you receive chat request and the user that requested chat has
        cdcc access, connection will be established automatically (useful
        for bots)
      - client will now show who set ban/topic and when if server supports
        that
      - nick watcher, read help on TAG and WHEREIS (I ripped this from
        ircuzi.irc, thanks to otiluke)

   Changed :
      - /FIND will now display users privilege
      - /CHELP has been renamed to /SHELP
      - Cdcc will now show all file lengths in KBytes
      - some print outs in Cdcc
      - some print outs in CTCP

   Fixed :
      - /NOTICE #channel wasn't displayed as it should be
      - /ADDF could crash under some circumstances, it works ok now (this
        was encountered rather rarely, japa figured that out)
      - if there were some problems with MOTD file on server, client wouldn't
        load ScrollZ.save (it is now loaded elsewhere, and there should be no
        problem now)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ScrollZ v1.5e, 2nd of December, 1995

   Added :
      - rehauled mass protection routines, when someone does twice the number
        of /DEOPS or /KICKS deops/kicks, he will be kicked from the channel,
        you can set this to on/off with /KICKONFLOOD
      - added some signoff messages to C-Toolz.addon (I'd like someone to
        make more :) )
      - from now on, client has date information along the version string so
        you can tell when I update it
      - added /CLEARTAB, it just clears all the people on tabkey list (imagine
        being up 10 days and messaging a lot of people, list gets really huge)
      - /CDCC will now display the percent of file transfer being completed
        in the progress bar
      - /LLOOK will store /LINKS info internally
      - /LLOOKUP will check /LINKS info against one stored internally (this
        is useful when riding the waves of splits :> )
      - if you get killed, client will store nick and userhost of the sucker
        that did it, you can check it out with /SHOWKILL
      - /SHOWNICK, when set to off, your nick won't be shown in publics like
        in plain vanilla client (requested by japa)

   Changed :
      - client has now new name, ScrollZ (HUGE thanks to No1 for making this
        up), change all your file names from C-Toolz.* to ScrollZ.*
      - /WALL will now let you include/exclude nicks from wall-op notices
      - /WHOIS and /WI will now send two nicks, this means you will get their
        idle time and away message automatically

   Fixed :
      - when received several invites to same channel, client would totally
        fuck things up if channel was on auto join list
      - /T will now let you set topic if you're not channel operator and mode
        +t isn't set for channel
      - small changes in extmes display
      - when adding user to friends list/shit list ~ in front of username was
        not removed, it works now
      - when user joins channel, actions are like this : if he is already
        banned, he will get kicked from channel, else shitlist is checked
        and finally friends list is checked (in that order)
      - fixed PROT level, if user with PROT level got banned client has deoped
        the offender, which is wrong behaviour :)
      - some stuff with C-Toolz.save

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

C-Toolz v1.5d, 20th of November, 1995

   Added :
      - CTCPCLOAK has new setting, HIDE, which will completely block
        all CTCP replies
      - if banned user joins channel, he will be kicked off automatically
        (useful to prevent lamers to hack into channels)
      - random sign off messages, they are in file C-Toolz.addon (lines
        starting with SIOFF denote sign off messages)

   Changed :
      - rehauled ADDF and ADDBK, they will now accept nick or filter.
        ADDFF and ADDBKF have been removed as they are no longer needed.
        Format of C-Toolz.save has slightly changed, I've included convert.c
        to convert old file to new one. Shitlist now consists of nick too
        (in older versions it included userhost only)
      - ADDF and ADDBK will now add users with filter when you specify nick
        to add. * will be used and userhost will be left out (only domain
        will be used)
      - BAN will now accept nick/filter
      - scatter kicks are now in separate file called C-Toolz.addon (lines
        starting with SKICK denote scatter kicks)
      - REMF and REMBK will now remove all users matching filter
      - when you quit, client will display your signoff message

   Fixed :
      - client will now correctly join channels starting with &
      - if CTCPCLOAK was on, user that pinged you got Pooong! notice,
        it will correctly hide it now
      - when user CTCP flooded you, he got notice about it even if
        CTCPCLOAK was on, it is now fixed
      - when CTCPCLOAK was on, messages about you pinging yourself were
        printed when ping was issued to measure lag
      - minor glitch in check lock routine
      - bug that prevented seeing that other people are away (a nasty one)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

C-Toolz v1.5c, 12th of November, 1995

   Added :
      - added double status bar, you can turn it on/off with
        SET DOUBLE_STATUS_LINE ON/OFF
      - uptime indicator (%1 in STATUS_FORMAT)
      - lag indicator (%2 in STATUS_FORMAT)
      - added dcc reget/resend, new command is CDCC RESEND, you can get
        files offered in resend mode as usual with CDCC GET
      - if someone is already using your nickname, client will automatically
        append _ to nickname (example: test -> test_ -> test__ -> test___ ->
        test____ -> test_____ -> now it asks you for nickname), but I still
        recommend colliding the sucker :->
      - WKICKOPS command, if set to ON channel operators will be kicked when
        saying a word from wordkick list (hander, you really make me busy :) )
      - ADDS, it adds given server to server list, coded by Sheik
      - REMS, it removes given server from server list, coded by Sheik
      - LISTS, it lists all servers on server list

   Changed:
      - STATUS_FORMAT variable now consists of STATUS_FORMAT1 and
        STATUS_FORMAT2, the former is equal to STATUS_FORMAT if you have set
        DOUBLE_STATUS_LINE to OFF
      - you can now specify multiple servers on command line (example:
        irc <your_nick> server1.com:6667 server2.net:6668) and when you
        are disconnected client will try to reconnect on first one. If it
        fails, it will pick next on the list and so on.
      - NHPROT is now changed, it will accept the display level after ON/OFF.
        Available display levels are quiet, medium and full. Do /CHELP NHPROT
        for more info (suggested by noHup)
      - LISTF and LISTBK will now accept filter

   Fixed:
      - client would crash when joining channels you were shitted on, it is
        now fixed (found out by JustMe_)
      - fixed Cdcc, it would now correctly list/send files matching user's
        filter (previously it would only list/send one pack)
      - bug that caused client to crash if many dccs were active concurrently
        (thanks to Sheik for this one !!!!!!)
      - client wouldn't react correctly on mass deop, it is now fixed
      - client crashed if you did /CDCC and there were zero length files
        in dcc list
      - nick flood was detected for yourself too, it is now fixed
      - IG will now correctly unignore user when IGNORETIME seconds pass by
      - when issued /RELOAD wordkick list wasn't cleaned so every time list
        doubled
      - when launching finger on users who had ~ in front of their username
        finger obviously failed
      - wordkick now works ok on HP-UX (thanks to hander for the fix)
      - when you set mode lock, it will also set mode on channel now
      - bug with double status line that caused client to crash (Sheik did
        that one, so he takes all the credit)
      - window "synch" bug (again all thanks must go to Sheik, he simply
        rewlz!!!)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

C-Toolz v1.5b, 15th of September, 1995

   Added :
      - when you get ops, the client will scan all bans and remove all bans 
        for people that are protected
      - when you get ops, people that have auto-op access or protection will
        be opped if they don't have ops
      - both of the above is also true when you join a channel
      - SHOWAWAY command, if you hate notifying your channel(s) that you
        are away/back, set this to OFF (added on PiC9's request)
      - if you quit from IRC when you have active dccs you will be warned
      - if you are disconnected from server, client will try to reconnect to
        default server (specified in C-Toolz.save)
      - I have changed AUTOOP to delayed AUTOOP (I started to hate it when
        like six people OP Sheik when he joins channels :-) ), it is buffered
        so if several users join channel within 6 seconds, only one notice
        will be sent to server, you can change delay in C-Toolz.save, if you
        set it to 0, delay op will be disabled
      - buffered notify, it will send userhost for 5 nicks at a time
      - upload and download dirs can now be set with CDCC

   Changed :
      - main changes in CDCC area, it now acts like HyperDCC (on commands
        like GET and CLOSE it lists all the DCCs and you specify which one
        to GET/CLOSE with strings like -3,5,6-8,10- or * for all. This is
        valid for all user CDCC requests too
      - if you wanna see all the people that CTCP you, set VERBOSE_CTCP to
        ON in your .ircrc file
      - SETTINGS now looks much better (done by JustMe_)

   Fixed :
      - some bugs in protection routines
      - a bug in netsplit clean-up, it caused client to crash if there
        was a multiple-server split
      - when you do SETAWAY/SETBACK, notice will be sent to all channels
        you are on
      - fixed clients AWAY -ALL command (it didn't work as it should)
      - channel statistics caused client to crash if there were no IRC ops
        (like we want them :) )
      - client should now compile on HP-UX without gcc, it wasn't a bug
        (I used ANSI prototypes on several occasions, thanks to Crash)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

C-Toolz v1.5a, 29th of August, 1995

   If you use notify, issue /SVE the first time you start your newly
   compiled client. After that, remove notify entries from your .ircrc
   file.

   Added :
      - ADDN command, it will add nick to your notify list
      - REMN command, it will remove nick from your notify list
      - LISTN command, it will list all nicks on notify list
      - client will display userhost info on notifys
      - IGTIME, it defines for how many seconds should client ignore
        people who flood you

   Changed :
      - UNBAN will now accept filter (ie. /UNBAN *@*.uni-lj.si would remove
        all bans matching *@*.uni-lj.si)
      - in ADDF and ADDFF you could use abbreviations I, C, O, A, U, P, G,
        now you can do like INV, C, AOP, UN, PROT, GOD (only the first
        letter matters)
      - some internal changes, should reduce memory usage (though you want
        notice that :) )
      - now there is a much smaller chance for a client to crash since I'm
        using new malloc and free routines

   Fixed :
      - fixed FINDUH, it listed the people on all channels instead on the
        ones you specify
      - if you have been using DEFSERVER in C-Toolz.save it might have
        crashed the client, it is now fixed
      - client crashed when you joined channel and someone did mode change
        if join wasn't synched yet

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

C-Toolz v1.5, 9th of August, 1995

   Added :
      - NICKST, it will print some statistics about user
   Changed :
      - some internal changes, integrating my stuff together with client
        more closely
      - CTCP WHOAMI will now return users userhost information
   Fixed :
      - fixed mega deop,mass kick and nick flood so it will work even if
        several users do it concurrently
      - fixed ban handling, there was a possibility to crash client on some
        occasions if you would issue unban
      - some minor fixes, mostly prints
      - memory usage should be slightly lower than before
      - fixed some functions dealing with WHOIS

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

C-Toolz v1.4b,  2nd of August, 1995

   Added :
      - major news is upgrade to client 2.8.2, the future work will now
        be done only on this client
      - first of all, do configure and then make, I've changed Makefile so
        make will work
      - default server is now saved in C-Toolz.save, you can edit it there
      - default signoff message is now saved in C-Toolz.save, you can edit
        it there
      - default setaway message is now saved in C-Toolz.save, you can edit
        it there
      - default setback message is now saved in C-Toolz.save, you can edit
        it there
      - finger message is now saved in C-Toolz.save, you can edit it there
      - userinfo message is now saved in C-Toolz.save, you can edit it there
      - MODELOCK command (suggested by EC)
      - MODEUNLOCK command, removes lock
      - if you are away, the time of the event (msg, kill, ban, ...) will be
        recorded along with the event 
      - MOP, mass op on current channel (suggested by noHup)
      - TBAN, works pretty much like in LiCe, it lists all the bans on the
        current channel and asks which one you wanna remove (suggested by
        noHup)
      - CTCPCLOAK, if you set it on, the client will act as usual one, ie
        normal ctcp version, userinfo, finger, clientinfo and ping reply, plus
        no 'You are not registered' notices (hander needed this so I put it in)
      - SERVNOTICE command, if you haven't noticed so far my client never
        displayed server notices (kills, fake modes and so on), now you can
        turn this on/off
      - FAKE command, it will display fake modes for all the channels you're
        on, it is ignored if SERVNOTICE is ON
      - SK command, scatterkick (suggested by hander)
      - RANSK, randomly picks a scatterkick
      - DEOPT, KICKT and NICKT, they regulate how many seconds should pass
        between deops, kicks and nick changes not to detect flooding (it is
        still related to DEOPS, KICKS and NICKS)
      - DIRLNK, I forgot to add it along with DIRLMK (doh)

   Changed :
      - bans are now stored internally (this made TBAN possible)
      - CHANST will now display IRC ops
      - IRCREAL variable is now renamed to IRCNAME, so edit your .profile or
        something
      - if you have auto join on invite turned on, it will join only
        channels you specify when you do /AJOIN ON channel_list, where
        channel_list is a list of channels separated with , like :
        #,#chat* (suggested by JustMe_)
      - all prints that were too big for one screen and required from you to
        press a key to continue are now handled in a better way, with
        prompts, and it now works with window sizes different then 25 lines
        (those are LISTF, LISTBK, SETBACK and CHELP)
      - all word kick entries are now saved into C-Toolz.save
      - CTCPs will also be logged if you're away

   Fixed :
      - when setaway or setback it will set you away on all the servers you 
        are connected to, not just the current server and set you back after
        you answer y/n to "Delete C-Toolz.away file ?"
      - CTCP nick CHOPS channel, didn't work at all (found by JustMe_)
      - fixed nickflood routine, it is now multiple channels compliant
      - client should now be multiple servers compliant (I hope so)
      - fixed RECONNECT, it will now reconnect correctly to servers that use
        ports different than 6667
      - fixed DIRLMK, it didn't work at all (thanks to noHup)
      - I have added checking for ops in every command that needs it (like
        K, BAN, CDBAN, ... I think you get it by now)
      - fixed tab key handling, it didn't add nick you sent message to

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

C-Toolz v1.4a, 11th of July, 1995

   Added :
      - GOD privilege, it will deop nick that has deoped/kicked/banned user
        with GOD privilege (suggested by EC)
      - DIRLMK command, it will kick specified nick with the last message
        you have received (suggested by EC)
      - RANLK command, it will randomly pick a lamer and kick him from your
        current channel, you can specify comment (suggested by EC)
      - logging of Cdcc while you're away, so you know who did something when
        you're not there (this includes logging of files that someone sends
        to you if your auto-get is turned on)
      - if someone invites you to a channel and auto join on invite is
        turned on, it will log it too

   Changed :
      - FINDUH will now accept second parameter, channel name, so it will
        only scan channels that match that parameter (suggested by JustMe_)
      - I have renamed RESET to RELOAD because I feel it corelates more with
        what it does
      - Rearranged code quite a lot, this will make upgrades to newer
        client versions easier. Expect upgrade to 2.8 in 2 or 3 weeks

   Fixed :
      - CSCAN now works ok if you specify channel as an argument (thanks to
        noHup for this one)
      - OP didn't work for EC, I think I know what was wrong (hopefully it
        is fixed now)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

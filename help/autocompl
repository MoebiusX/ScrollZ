Usage: AUTOCOMPL on string|auto string|off
  If set to on or auto, client will do the nick completion for you on
  public messages. If public message starts with 'blah:' client will
  search for nick starting with 'blah' on current channel and insert
  that nick in place of 'blah'. If more than one nick matches blah,
  public message is left untouched (unless someone has nick that exactly
  matches blah, in that case client will use their full nick). When set
  to auto, client will use first nick that matches. Second argument with
  on or auto is string that'll be inserted on right side of the nick.
  If set to off, message is left untouched. 
  right side of the nick.

Usage: SET PAUSE_AFTER_MOTD [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
  When ON, this will cause ScrollZ to wait for a keystroke after
  the local ScrollZ motd is displayed then clear the screen and
  continue.  If OFF, the local motd will be displayed,
  immediately followed by the server banners and motds.  If
  there is no local ScrollZ motd, this variable has no effect.
  PAUSE_AFTER_MOTD only works for the ScrollZ motds and *not* for
  server motds.

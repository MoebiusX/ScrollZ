Usage: SET STAMP_FORMAT <time stamp format>
  Sets the prefix used for otherwise unadorned messages.  The
  default is "$Z$color(cyan)|$color(off)" for client compiled
  with color support and "%Z|" otherwise.  This value
  undergoes alias expansion before being displayed.  This
  only works if time stamp is set to ON or MAX.

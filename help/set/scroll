Usage: SET SCROLL [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
  Turns ON or OFF screen scrolling.  While OFF, when the cursor
  reaches the bottom of the screen, it jumps to the top and
  overwrites its way back down.  This mode is recommended for
  *extremely* dumb terminals.  When ON, the screen will scroll
  old information off the top.

Usage: SET ENCRYPT_PROGRAM <encryption program path>
  Sets the program used to encrypt messages.  The program
  selected must take an encryption key as the first line
  written to work with ircII, with the second and subsequent
  lines the text to be encrypted, which is expected on the
  programs standard output.

  Note that in ircII 4.4 and previous, this variables program
  API was different.  Originally the encryption key was the
  command line argument, and the program a true filter.
  However, it is not secure from local users snooping the
  key and being able to decrypt messages, should they obtain
  them.  Set the OLD_ENCRYPT_PROGRAM variable to ON
  to obtain this old behaviour.

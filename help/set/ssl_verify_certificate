Usage: SET SSL_VERIFY_CERTIFICATE [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
  If ON, client will verify whether server's certificate is valid
  when connecting via SSL. If OFF, no certificate verification is
  performed but warnings will still be printed if certificate is
  not valid. You might want to disable certificate verification when
  connecting to a server which is using a self signed certificate.

Usage: SET ENCRYPT_PAD_MSGS [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
  Pad private messages with random invisible characters to
  make encryption less susceptible to frequency analysis
  attacks. It is recommended that the option is kept enabled,
  unless parties you are communicating with have known issues
  (with invisible characters) or experience problems. The
  aforementioned applies only to FiSH encryption.

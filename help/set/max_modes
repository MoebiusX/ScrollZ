Usage: SET MAX_MODES <number of modes per line>
  This will limit the number of modes that one mode line
  can send to the IRC server. (default is 4).
  Some IRC servers put a limit on number of modes one can
  use in one mode line (for example on IRCnet one
  should set this variable to 3). The valid number is
  between 1 and 6.

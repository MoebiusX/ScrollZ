Usage: SET STATUS_FORMAT <format description for status line>
  Setting the variable allows you to alter the appearance of the
  status line.  Certain special characters are recognized in
  this format line and replaced with various bits of status line
  information.  Each of these special characters is preceeded by
  a '%'.  Here is a list of these characters:

       1	  Value of STATUS_UPTIME variable. *

       8          Current status of Cdcc security (S=on, s=off). *
       9          Current channel's topic. *

  Those marked with * are only displayed in the status line when
  certain conditions are met.  Please get help on the variables
  mentioned above for specifics about each one.

  For example, the standard default ScrollZ status line format
  looks like this:

  %y1[%y2%R%y6] %y2%*%y6%y3%@%y6%y7%N%y6%#%C%+%A%Q%S%I%O %y3%W%y6
  %F%y9%H%y6 %> [lj %y5%3%y6]%y0
  which when expanded for the nickname Dae on the channel #blue
  [1] @Dae on #blue (+tn)                        [lj Dae/#blue]

  The window number %R is 1
  The nickname %N is Dae   and Dae is a channel op %@  @
  Dae is on channel %C #blue
  The mode %+ calls up the contents of the STATUS_MODE variable
      and displays the channel modes, (+ps)
  The end of the status_format %3 expands to the contents of
      person that last joined #blue "Dae/#blue"
  
  Everything else is ignored unless it's needed.
 
  You can now include text modification characters
  (^B, ^V, ^_ and ^O) in STATUS_FORMAT. If you change
  the format at the start of STATUS_FORMAT, you will
  have to do it again after any %C or %U, as these
  both reset it to reverse video. Additionaly %y1
  to %y6 expand to values of COLOR SBAR and %y7 to
  %y9, %ya, %yb and %yc expand to values of COLOR SBAR2.
  You can turn all colors off with %y0.

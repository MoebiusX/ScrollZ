Usage: SET STATUS_WINDOW <text displayed in current window status line>
  The value of STATUS_WINDOW is replaced in the STATUS_FORMAT
  variable for an occurence of %W if the window is the current
  window.  If the window is not the current window (or if there
  is only one window visible), then %W is replaced with nothing.

Usage: SET DCC_PORTS <low port>[-<high port>]
  Controls the ports used when exchanging files using
  DCC SEND or DCC GET.

  The default is to use whatever ports are returned by the
  underlying operating system. If you are behind a firewall
  you can control what ports the client will attempt to
  use for the DCC protocol. Only ports in range 1024 to
  65500 are allowed. The range is inclusive - meaning that
  both the low port and the high port will be used. You
  can also use colon (:) as a separator instead of minus (-).

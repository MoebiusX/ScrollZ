Usage: SET TRACE [ALL|NONE|[-]<level> [-]<level> ...]
  The setting of this variable determines which events are
  stored in the trace file.  If ALL is specified, all
  events are saved in the trace file. If NONE is specified,
  no events are saved in the trace file. 
  The <level> specification can be one of the following: 
    SERVER          Server information
    CONNECT         Server connections
    JOIN            Channel joins
    PART            Channel parts
    CHANNEL         Channel information
    IO              What is sent to / received from the server
    WHOWAS          Whowas cache
    NICK            Nick changes
    WINDOW          Window information
  You can combine these on a command line to save the events
  that you want.  Also, by putting a - before any level, you
  remove that one from the list.  For example, if you
  wish to save everything except JOINs and PARTs, you
  could do:
    SET TRACE ALL -JOIN -PART
  which is the same as doing:
    SET TRACE SERVER CONNECT CHANNEL IO WHOWAS WINDOW

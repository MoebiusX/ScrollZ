Usage: LASTLOG [<flag>] [<pattern>] [<number of entries> [<from entry>]]]
  Displays the contents of the lastlog.  This is a list of the
  most recent messages that have appeared on the screen.  LASTLOG
  is useful to redisplay the screen if you inadvertantly do a
  CLEAR or miss messages for other reasons.

  If no arguments are given, the entire lastlog is displayed. If a <pattern>
  argument is given, only with <pattern> in them are displayed.  If the
  first argument is a number, it determines how many log entries to show,
  or if searching for a pattern, how many entries to search.  Otherwise it
  is searched for in every lastlog entry. The second argument determines how
  many lines back to start display from. Thus
    LASTLOG 4 8
  Shows 4 lines of the lastlog, starting at line 8...  lines 8,
  9, 10, 11 are displayed.  Furthermore:
    LASTLOG bigcheese
  displays only those lastlog entries that contain the word "bigcheese".  
  The following will, starting at line 4 searching for 8 lines, search
  for lastlog entires that contain the word "phone".
    LASTLOG phone 8 4

Usage: WALL [#channel] [+nick|-nick] text
  Words starting with - will be checked against nicks on channel
  and if matched, those nicks will be excluded from wall-op notice.
  The same is true for words starting with + except that those
  nicks will be included in wall-op notice. If channel is omitted,
  current channel is used.

Usage: ADDFCHAN filter|#number channel
  Number is the same as in TBAN or CDCC GET. Example :
  #-2,4,6-8,12- will operate on user entries 1,2,6,7,8 and all entries
  from 12 and on. Numbers for entries are shown with LISTF. Note
  that channel must match the one in userlist entry if you wish to
  remove it (no wildcards are allowed). If #number is does not start
  with digit, it is considered a channel name, and in that case all
  channel will be added to all entries that match #number.

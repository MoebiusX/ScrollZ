Usage: REMF nick|filter
  Removes user from your friends list

  Filter can include * and ? or start with #. If it starts with
  #, you can use filters like in Cdcc and TBAN. Example :
  #-2,4,6-8,12- will delete user entries 1,2,6,7,8 and all entries
  from 12 on. Numbers for entries are shown with LISTF.
  Channel matching is also performed if filter starts with #,
  in this case entries with channel match will be removed.

*Usage: NOTE KEY [&<passwd>] [+|-<flags>] [+|-<maxtime>] <nick!user@host>
*  KEY is an alias for USER +KR (default max 1 day)
*  This command is for allowing no-opers to use oper-options by specifying
*  the flag to unlock. Be careful with this option!
*  Example: KEY +365 +s * would make it possible for everybody to use s flag.

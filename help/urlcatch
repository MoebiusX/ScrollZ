Usage: URLCATCH on|auto|quiet|off
  Toggles URL catcher on/off

  If set to AUTO, client will look for publics with *tp:/*.* in them and
  use NOTEPAD to save such entries. QUIET works the same, the only
  difference is that no message will be printed about stored URLs. When set
  to ON, you can use URL to save last grabbed URL.

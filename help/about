  Thank you and stuff

  First of all, some ScrollZ background: I decided to write ScrollZ
  because I haven't been satisfied with any of the scripts I have
  tried (including PhoEniX, GargOyle and Toolz). Special thanks goes
  to Sheik for his help. I would also like to greet everyone I know,
  including #warez2, #, #warez, #f1, #cracking and #ScrollZ.
  Special greets to SZ/Net people and to all non-idiotic IRC ops.
  Special thanks to all the people that provided me with accounts,
  ircII authors and, last but not least Linux community.

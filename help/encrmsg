Usage: ENCRMSG [-PASS master password] [-CLEAR] [-SHOW] [target [key]]
  Communication with nick/channel will be encrypted using key. Both
  parties have to use the same key for encryption/decryption to work.
  If only nick is specified you will be prompted for a password. If
  nick is prepended with a '-' encrypted communication with that nick
  is ended. If neither user nor key are given all users in encryption
  list are listed. DCC CHAT sessions can be encrypted if nick starts
  with '='. Use '-' as first character in key if you want to communicate
  with users of ScrollZ v1.8j and older. Whenever encrypted communication
  is used publics and private messages are prepended with [!]. DCC CHAT
  messages are encrypted if nick is enclosed in *. Warning: messages are
  cut at 304 characters to avoid decryption problems when IRC server cuts
  the message. To see the passwords used for encryption specify -SHOW.
  To clear the encryption list specify -CLEAR. You can set master
  password with command PASSWD. Use -PASS to specify master password
  on a command line.

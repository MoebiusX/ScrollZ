Usage: FLOODP on|off|max #messages #seconds
  If set to on, users that flood you will be ignored for seconds set with
  IGTIME. If set to off, no action is performed on flood. If set to max
  and you receive at least #messages in #seconds, client will change
  nick to prevent further flooding. Make sure you set this high enough to
  prevent false flood attack detection.

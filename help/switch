Usage: SWITCH (text to be matched)
       {
         (sample text)
         {
           ...
         }
         (sample text2)
         (sample text3)
         {
           ...
         }
         ...
       }
  The (...) expression is taken to be regular expando-text
  (much like the (...) body of FE. The {...} body is
  taken to be a series of [(...)] {...} pairs. The [(...)]
  expression is taken to be one or more consecutive (...)
  structures, which are taken to be text expressions to match
  against the header text. If any of the (...) expressions
  are found to match, then the commands in the {...} body
  are executed. There may be as many such [(...)] {...}
  pairs as you need. However, only the *first* pair found
  to be matching is actually executed, and the others are
  ignored, so placement of your switches are rather important:
  put your most general ones last.

  Example:
  alias blah {
    switch ($0) {
      (1) {
        echo you entered 1
      }
      (2) {
        echo you entered 2
      }
      (3)
      (4)
      (5) {
        echo you entered 3,4 or 5
      }
    }
  }
  eval ^input "enter your choice: " blah $$*

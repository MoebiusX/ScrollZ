Usage: CDCC QUEUE [LIST [filter]]|[REMOVE filter]|[FLUSH]
  Without arguments it will list number of files in queue. If you pass it
  LIST it will show you detailed list with filename and who is it sending
  file to. If filter is passed after LIST, only files that go to nicks
  matching filter will be listed. Filter can include * and ?. You can
  remove files from queue by specifying filter after REMOVE. Filter is
  the same as in CDCC GET. FLUSH will force the queue to be flushed
  in case it is stuck for some reason.

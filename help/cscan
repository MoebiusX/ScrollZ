  Without arguments it will show users for current channel. If -H is
  passed as first argument, users will be listed in following order:
  shitlisted users, normal users, voiced users (+v), channel operators
  and at last your friends. If -R is passed as first argument, the
  above order is reversed, friends showing up first and shitlisted
  people showing up last.

Usage: ECHO [<anything you want>]
  This simply displays all of it's arguments.  However, it's not
  that simple.  ECHO will work even if DISPLAY is set to OFF,
  making it useful in your .scrollzrc file.  Also, ECHO will work in
  the action portion of an ON command in all modes.  This can be
  used to redefine the way messages appear.

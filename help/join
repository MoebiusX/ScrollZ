Usage: JOIN [-NOWHO] [-INVITE|<channel_list> [<key>]]
  Changes your current channel to the channel specified.
  If no parameters are given, your current channel is displayed.

  Channel names begin with a # or & and may contain any character
  except space, carriage return, null and line feed. For example,
  #My_Channel, # or #!@$%^&* are valid channel names.
  Channel names beginning with the character '&' are local to your server.

  If the specified channel does not already exist, it will be created.
  Otherwise, if MODE +k <key> is enabled on the channel, you will have to
  supply the <key> to complete join.

Available switches:
  -NOWHO
    If the -NOWHO switch is used, client will not request WHO list from
    the IRC server. Use this if server disconnects you upon joining
    large channels. Using this switch may disable some functionality
    built into the client. Client will store this flag internally and
    will not request WHO list upon rejoining the channel. To enable
    requesting WHO list upon join, leave the channel and join it
    normally, without -NOWHO switch.
  -INVITE
    If the -INVITE switch is used, you will join the channel that you were
    last INVITED to.  Or, if we wish to be grammatically correct,
    you will join the channel to which you were last invited.

Note:
  Joining a channel does not cause you to leave your previous
  channel unless NOVICE is set to ON. See SET NOVICE
  If you have NOVICE off, it is possible to join several channels
  at the same time.. with
    JOIN #channel1,#channel2,#channel3
  You must use commas and no spaces to separate the channel names.

  CHANNEL and JOIN are identical.

See Also:
  SET NOVICE
  MODE for information about changing channel characteristics.

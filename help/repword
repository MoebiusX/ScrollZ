Usage: REPWORD reply_trigger
  Allows you to change your AutoReply buffer

  Considered a good idea to set this to first few letters of your nick.
  You can set multiple strings that will trigger auto reply, separate
  them with ','. If string starts with '-' it will cause the line not
  to match (example: *oo*,-*foo* would match all lines with *oo* except
  those with *foo*).

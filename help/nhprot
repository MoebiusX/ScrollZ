Usage: NHPROT on channels|off quiet|medium|full
  When set to OFF, no action will be taken on netsplit hacks. If ON,
  it will deop people that are not on your friends list. Display type
  toggles the info that is displayed when netsplit/netjoin occurs. If
  set to QUIET, it will behave like normal client would. When set to
  MEDIUM, only netsplit/netjoin will be reported. FULL level is like
  MEDIUM but will display netsplit hacks too. People that left with
  netsplit will be stored internally only if display level is set to
  MEDIUM or FULL.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ScrollZ
is advanced IRC client based on ircII code. It adds features
normally found in ircII scripts.
.PP
The main difference between these scripts and
.B ScrollZ
is the code. Where
ircII scripts take a lot of disk and memory space and run slow,
.B ScrollZ
only takes a couple of extra kilobytes compared to stock ircII client
yet runs faster than any ircII script. This was accomplished by using
C code instead of ircII scripting language. This reduces memory and
CPU usage and code tends to run faster.
.B ScrollZ
includes features such as built-in userlist, shitlist, improved
scripting, Blowfish based encryption, features for
.B IRC
operators and user friendly features such as completion for nicks
and channels.

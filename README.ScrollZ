I would like to thank the following individuals: f0x for scrollz.com,
acidflash for patches and support, ogre, Anton and colrebel for arranging
and maintaining the FTP site/mirrors, Ahnberg for the FTP mirror and the
mailing list, largo for the web page design, tel for the web space,
Sheik for cdcc.c, whowas.c and edit2.c.lame, and Saud for the FTP mirror.
Also thanks to Sharky and Darkie for permission to use the code from their
BitchX SSL port - it was modified as ircII code differs a lot from the EPIC
code these days.

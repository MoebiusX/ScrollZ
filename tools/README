These are some ScrollZ related tools that were sitting on my hard
disk for last couple of years.

SZsetup is ANSI based colour setup utility for ScrollZ. Compile it
with: cc -o SZsetup SZsetup.c
xSZsetup is Tcl/Tk based colour utility for ScrollZ. It is ready
for use as long as you have a working Tcl/Tk installation.

Thanks and stuff (jm_'s comment):
   Well actually thanks go to all people that will use xSZsetup (and those
   that will just give it a try).
   Big thanks to Frank Pilhofer (author of uudeview) for letting me use stuff
   from xdeview (tk_SelectFiles, CompressSlashes, CanonPattern and MFSSelect-
   Show). xdeview also served me as an example to learn Tcl/Tk.

SZdecode is a decrypter for encrypted ScrollZ.away files.
